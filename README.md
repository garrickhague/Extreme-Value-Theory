# Analyzing the Impact of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on Precipitation

## Overview

This project, conducted by Garrick Hague, focuses on analyzing the impact of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on precipitation patterns in the Lake Tahoe region. By examining variations in precipitation across different locations and applying statistical methods, the study aims to provide insights into the relationship between topography and precipitation distribution.

## Objectives

1. **Familiarize with the topography of the Lake Tahoe region:** Gain an understanding of the geographical features influencing precipitation patterns.

2. **Examine precipitation differences between three locations:** Compare and contrast precipitation levels across different areas in the Lake Tahoe region.

3. **Compare correlation of yearly max precipitation:** Investigate the correlation between maximum precipitation amounts recorded annually at each location.

4. **Apply Extreme Value Theory to estimate the likelihood of maximum precipitation per region:** Utilize statistical techniques to estimate the probability of extreme precipitation events in different areas.

## Motivation

Growing up in Carson City, Nevada, Garrick Hague's curiosity about the inconsistencies in snowfall and vegetation between regions near Lake Tahoe and Sacramento led him to pursue a degree in Atmospheric Science. This study is driven by his fascination with weather patterns and aims to unravel the complexities of precipitation distribution in the Lake Tahoe region.

## Conclusion

The analysis concludes that precipitation levels vary across the Lake Tahoe region due to its diverse topography. The study identifies the influence of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on precipitation distribution and highlights the importance of understanding local topographical features in predicting extreme weather events. The findings have implications for local authorities and emergency management teams in devising strategies to mitigate the impact of extreme precipitation events.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future research include exploring the correlation between precipitation and other weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind patterns. Additionally, extending the analysis of Extreme Value Theory to examine other extreme weather phenomena and assessing the impact of climate change on precipitation patterns could provide further insights into the region's climatic dynamics.
